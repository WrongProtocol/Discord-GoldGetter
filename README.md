Hello! This is the GoldGetter bot for Discord.

The purpose of this bot is to fetch the current gold price and be a "premium calculator" for the users of the 2is1 discord server about gold and precious metals. 
It's made just for fun. It runs in a lightweight docker. 

there's an unpublished .env file that sets the DISCORD_TOKEN as well as the GOLD_LOOKUP_URL
so 
**you will have to fill those in with your own token / url**

**Usage:**

Get the spot price of gold: 

!gold

Can also convert to other currencies:  

!gold CAD

Also functions as a spot calculator to check how much over/under an ask is based on the specified weight. 


!gold 2800 1

!gold 1400 .5

!gold 300 .1 CAD


Enjoy

Thanks,
WrongProtocol
