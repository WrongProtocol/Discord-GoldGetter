Hello! This is the GoldGetter bot for Discord.

The purpose of this bot is to fetch the current gold price and be a "premium calculator" for the users of the 2is1 discord server about gold and precious metals. 
It's made just for fun. It runs in a lightweight docker. 

there's an unpublished .env file that sets the DISCORD_TOKEN as well as the GOLD_LOOKUP_URL
so 
**you will have to fill those in with your own token / url**

Enjoy

Thanks,
WrongProtocol
